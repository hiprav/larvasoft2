          Software has a specific product lifecycle that governs the operating
          systems with which the Software is compatible and how long the
          Software will be supported by Larvasoft Tech Apps. Software is
          possibly not compatible with operating systems that are not specified
          in the product lifecycle or once the support period has expired.

          transferred or decompiled (i.e. recompilation into the source code),
          unless expressly permitted by the EULA or permitted according to law.
          If the Customer wishes to reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble
          the Software (hereinafter referred to as "De-compilation") for the

          information necessary for the achievement of such interoperability. If
          Larvasoft Tech Apps supplies such information concerning
          interoperability without undue delay, the Customer shall not be
          entitled to decompile the Software. Software for which no special
          Licenses for Multiple Use are available according to the relevant
          product information is restricted to use on one Computer by a
          Customer. For this purpose, the Customer may use any available
          Computer that meets the system requirements and for which the License
          was granted. Should the Customer change the Computer, the Software
          must be deleted from the Computer on which the Software was previously
          installed before the reinstallation of the Software on a different
          Computer. For Software whose product information provides special
          Licenses for Multiple Use, Multiple Use shall be permissible only if,
          and to the extent that, the Customer purchased and was granted the
          relevant type or number of Licenses by Larvasoft Tech Apps.
